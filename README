This will eventually be a very small and simple Python parser library. 

STATUS (as at 8th Feb 2010):  I've gone right "back to basics", and am 
starting again using some code from the public-domain Yeanpypa parsing 
library by Markus Bruckner.  Many thanks to Markus for doing Yeanpypa!  

 This code is in the public-domain.  
 "Share and enjoy....."    :)
